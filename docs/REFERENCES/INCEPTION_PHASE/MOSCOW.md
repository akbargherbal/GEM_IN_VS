# Gemini CLI VS Code Bridge - MoSCoW Feature Matrix

## Problem Statement

**Context**: Development workflows are disrupted by constant context-switching between VS Code and terminal when using Gemini CLI. The terminal environment lacks proper text editing capabilities and doesn't maintain a coherent conversation history.

**Problem**: Enable seamless, stateful interaction with Gemini CLI entirely within VS Code through a file-based interface that preserves conversational context and eliminates terminal dependency.

**Target Users**: Python-centric developers who live in VS Code and prioritize automation and efficiency over command-line interaction.

**Success Criteria**: User can launch bridge once, then conduct complete multi-turn Gemini conversations using only VS Code file editing for entire sessions.

**Constraints**: Must maintain single persistent Gemini CLI process to preserve conversational state. Must be transparent to all Gemini CLI features including MCP servers.

**Assumptions**: Users have Gemini CLI installed and configured. VS Code is primary development environment. Python runtime available.

**Out of Scope**: VS Code extension development, GUI interfaces, multi-user support, cloud synchronization.

## MVP Feature Matrix

### Must Have (Critical for MVP)

**Core Process Management**
- **Persistent Gemini CLI Process**: Launch and maintain single long-running `gemini` process in background to preserve conversational context throughout session
- **Process Lifecycle Management**: Start Gemini CLI as child process with captured stdin/stdout streams for reliable communication
- **Graceful Process Termination**: Properly terminate Gemini CLI process when bridge script exits to prevent orphaned processes

**File-Based I/O System**
- **Input File Monitoring**: Watch `prompt.md` for file save events and trigger prompt processing immediately upon changes
- **Complete File Content Processing**: Read entire content of `prompt.md` as single prompt (no parsing, markers, or special syntax required)
- **Append-Only Output Logging**: Write all Gemini CLI responses to `response.md` in append mode, never overwriting existing content
- **Real-time Response Capture**: Capture Gemini CLI stdout in dedicated background thread and immediately write to output file

**Transparent Communication Pipeline**
- **Stdin/Stdout Bridge**: Act as transparent data pipe between file system and Gemini CLI process without modifying content
- **Full Feature Compatibility**: Preserve all Gemini CLI functionality including MCP server integration without interference
- **Newline Handling**: Properly format prompts with newlines to trigger Gemini CLI execution

### Should Have (Important but not critical)

**Error Handling & Recovery**
- **Gemini CLI Crash Recovery**: Detect when Gemini CLI process terminates unexpectedly and provide clear error messaging
- **File System Error Handling**: Handle file permission issues, disk space problems, and missing file scenarios gracefully
- **Network Issue Resilience**: Continue operation when Gemini CLI experiences temporary API connectivity issues

**User Experience Enhancements**
- **Startup Confirmation**: Provide clear console output confirming successful bridge startup and Gemini CLI connection
- **Process Status Monitoring**: Display bridge status and Gemini CLI health in console output
- **Clean Shutdown Handling**: Respond to Ctrl+C and system shutdown signals to terminate cleanly

**File Management**
- **Automatic File Creation**: Create `prompt.md` and `response.md` if they don't exist at startup
- **File Lock Detection**: Handle scenarios where files are locked by other processes or editors
- **UTF-8 Encoding Support**: Ensure proper handling of Unicode characters in prompts and responses

### Could Have (Nice to have if resources allow)

**Configuration Options**
- **Customizable File Names**: Allow users to specify alternative names for input/output files via command-line arguments
- **Configurable Gemini CLI Path**: Support custom Gemini CLI installation locations
- **Working Directory Flexibility**: Allow bridge to operate from different directories than where files are located

**Advanced Features**
- **Multiple Input Files**: Support watching multiple prompt files for different conversation threads
- **Response Timestamping**: Add timestamps to responses in output file for better conversation tracking
- **Conversation Session Markers**: Insert session boundaries in output file when bridge restarts
- **File Backup System**: Automatically backup response file periodically to prevent data loss

**Developer Experience**
- **Debug Mode**: Verbose logging option for troubleshooting bridge operation
- **Performance Metrics**: Track and display response times and system resource usage
- **Configuration File Support**: Allow settings to be specified in config file instead of command-line arguments

### Won't Have (Explicitly excluded from this version)

**GUI Components**
- **VS Code Extension**: No VS Code extension development - file-based interface only
- **Web Interface**: No browser-based interface or web dashboard
- **Desktop Application**: No standalone GUI application wrapper

**Advanced Integration Features**
- **Real-time Syntax Highlighting**: No custom syntax highlighting for prompt files
- **Auto-completion**: No intelligent prompt suggestions or auto-completion features
- **Multi-user Support**: No support for multiple users or shared conversations

**Cloud & Sync Features**
- **Cloud Synchronization**: No automatic syncing of conversations to cloud services
- **Remote Bridge Access**: No network-based access to bridge from remote machines
- **Conversation Sharing**: No built-in sharing or export features for conversations

**Alternative Interface Models**
- **REST API**: No HTTP API for programmatic access to bridge functionality
- **WebSocket Interface**: No real-time bidirectional communication protocols
- **Database Storage**: No persistent storage beyond simple file append operations

## Technical Requirements

**Technology Stack**: Python 3.7+ with standard library modules (subprocess, threading, watchdog for file monitoring)

**Performance Requirements**: Sub-second response time for file change detection, minimal CPU/memory overhead during idle periods

**Security Requirements**: No additional security measures beyond file system permissions - bridge operates with same privileges as user

**Integration Requirements**: Must work with any properly configured Gemini CLI installation and all MCP server configurations

**Deployment Requirements**: Single Python script execution, no installation or package management required

**Data Requirements**: File-based storage only, no databases or complex data structures needed
