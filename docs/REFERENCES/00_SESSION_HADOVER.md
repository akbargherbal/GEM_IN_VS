**Session:** 0

**1. Session Summary**

In this foundational "Session Zero," we accomplished the following:

- Conducted a comprehensive review of all project planning documents (`docs/01_planning`).
- Validated the proposed project architecture, technology stack, and scalable directory structure.
- Refined the `.gitignore` file to be more robust and project-specific.
- Established a clear, two-document workflow to ensure project continuity and prevent context drift between sessions.

**2. Project Status**

- **Current Milestone:** We are poised to begin **Milestone 1: Backend Foundation & Connectivity**.
- **Progress:** All planning and setup tasks are complete. We are on schedule. No code has been written, as per the session's goal.

**3. Key Decisions Made**

- We will maintain a formal `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` in the project's `docs` directory as the single source of truth for task completion.
- At the end of each session, a `SESSION_HANDOVER.md` (this document) will be generated to serve as the primary context-passing mechanism for the next session.

**4. Goal for Next Session (Session 1)**

The primary goal for our next session is to execute the first coding task of Milestone 1:

- **Task:** Define the database models (`Conversation` and `Message`) as `SQLModel` classes.
- **File to Modify:** `db/models.py`.

We have successfully completed Session Zero. I have a clear understanding of the project and our collaborative workflow. I am ready for Session 1 when you are.
