# Gemini CLI VS Code Bridge - Project Tracker v0.1.0

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-27 (Session 1 - Project Initialization)

### **1. Governance and Change Control**

This document serves as the single source of truth for tracking the implementation progress of the Gemini CLI VS Code Bridge. Its structure and tasks are directly derived from the Development Execution Plan (`docs/REFERENCES/DOCUMENT_04.md`).

**Change Protocol:** The original execution plan is considered the project's constitution. Should a situation arise where a task in this tracker cannot be completed as planned, or a fundamental assumption is proven incorrect, the following protocol will be initiated:

1. **Proposal:** The AI Assistant will explicitly flag the issue and propose a change to the core plan.
2. **Impact Analysis:** The AI Assistant will identify which aspects of the execution plan are impacted by the proposed change.
3. **Approval:** The User (Lead Developer) must approve the change before any implementation proceeds.
4. **Documentation Update:** Upon approval, the AI Assistant will first provide the updated text for the relevant execution plan sections.
5. **Tracker Update:** Only after the foundational documents are amended will this Project Tracker be updated to reflect the new plan.

This ensures that our project's "law" and its "enforcement" remain in perfect alignment at all times.

### **4. Current Phase Detailed Tracking**

#### **Phase 0: Critical Validation (Weeks 1-2)**

**Quality Gates:**

- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies defined for identified platform-specific issues

**Tasks:**

##### **Subprocess Communication Proof-of-Concept** (Est: 3-4 days) `Not Started`
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Gemini CLI responds reliably to programmatic stdin with various prompt types (simple text, multi-line, special characters, code blocks)
- **Dependencies:** Gemini CLI installation and API authentication on all platforms
- **Risk Level:** High - Core architecture viability depends on this validation
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Set up development environment with Python 3.8+ on all target platforms
  - [ ] Install and configure Gemini CLI across Windows, macOS, Linux
  - [ ] Implement basic subprocess communication test script
  - [ ] Test 50+ prompt variations with response validation
  - [ ] Document platform-specific subprocess behaviors

##### **Threading Model Validation** (Est: 2-3 days) `Not Started`
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Two-thread model (main + output reader) operates without deadlocks through 1000+ rapid queue operations
- **Dependencies:** Subprocess PoC completion for realistic testing conditions
- **Risk Level:** High - Deadlock potential is primary architectural concern
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Implement basic two-thread coordination model
  - [ ] Create bounded queue communication system (maxsize=100)
  - [ ] Develop automated stress testing framework
  - [ ] Execute 1000+ rapid iteration tests
  - [ ] Implement shutdown coordination via threading.Event

##### **Cross-Platform Behavior Documentation** (Est: 2-3 days) `Not Started`
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Platform-specific subprocess configurations and limitations clearly documented
- **Dependencies:** Subprocess and threading validation completion
- **Risk Level:** Medium - Required for Phase 1 implementation decisions
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Document subprocess startup/shutdown behaviors per platform
  - [ ] Test file system event handling across platforms
  - [ ] Identify platform-specific configuration requirements
  - [ ] Create compatibility matrix with supported OS versions
  - [ ] Document known limitations and workarounds

##### **Architecture Decision Documentation** (Est: 1-2 days) `Not Started`
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Final architecture approach selected with technical justification and fallback plans
- **Dependencies:** All validation tasks completed
- **Risk Level:** Low - Documentation task but critical for team alignment
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Analyze validation results and performance characteristics
  - [ ] Document chosen architecture with technical rationale
  - [ ] Define fallback strategy (sequential processing if needed)
  - [ ] Create implementation roadmap for Phase 1
  - [ ] Document risk mitigation strategies

### **5. Development Environment Setup**

**Required Components:**
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed on all target platforms
- [ ] Gemini CLI installed and authenticated
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Testing framework (pytest) configured
- [ ] Cross-platform testing environment access (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- **Status:** Not yet tested
- **Early Warning Signs to Watch:** Thread join operations >5 seconds, queue blocking during shutdown, memory growth, increasing response times
- **Mitigation Ready:** Timeout mechanisms, bounded queues, deadlock detection, sequential fallback

#### **Cross-Platform Subprocess Variations** - Risk Level: HIGH
- **Status:** Not yet tested
- **Early Warning Signs to Watch:** Platform-specific test failures, different response times, encoding/path issues, orphan processes
