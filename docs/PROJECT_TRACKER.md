# Gemini CLI Bridge - Project Tracker v1.0.0

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-28 (Session 1 - Project Kickoff)

## **1. Governance and Change Control**

This document serves as the single source of truth for tracking the implementation progress of the Gemini CLI VS Code Bridge MVP. Its structure and tasks are directly derived from the Development Execution Plan (`formatted_execution_plan.md`).

**Change Protocol:** The original planning document is considered the project's constitution. Should a situation arise where a task in this tracker cannot be completed as planned, or a fundamental assumption is proven incorrect, the following protocol will be initiated:

1. **Proposal:** The AI Assistant will explicitly flag the issue and propose a change to the core plan.
2. **Impact Analysis:** The AI Assistant will identify which parts of the execution plan are impacted.
3. **Approval:** The Developer must approve the change before any implementation proceeds.
4. **Documentation Update:** Upon approval, the execution plan document will be updated first.
5. **Tracker Update:** Only after the plan is amended will this Project Tracker be updated to reflect the new approach.

This ensures that our project's "law" and its "enforcement" remain in perfect alignment at all times.

- **Repository Status:** Initial setup required

---

## **3. Phase Checklist**

### **Phase 1: Core Workflow "Steel Thread" - Week 1 (`In Progress`)**

**Goal:** Implement the absolute minimum functionality to validate the core user journey: a user can save a prompt in `prompt.md` and see a stateful response appear in `response.md`.

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] Python >= 3.8 installed and verified
- [ ] `gemini` CLI tool installed and authenticated
- [ ] Initial project structure created (`bridge.py`, `prompt.md`, `response.md`)

**Exit Criteria:**

- [ ] A 5-turn contextual conversation with the `gemini` CLI can be completed successfully using only file edits
- [ ] All Phase 1 features are implemented and pass basic manual tests
- [ ] The core logic is contained within a single `bridge.py` script

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **[P1.T1] Persistent Gemini CLI Process Launch** (Est: 0.5 days)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The `bridge.py` script successfully starts the `gemini` command as a long-running child process using `subprocess.Popen`. The process's `stdin` and `stdout` are piped.
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Risk Level:** Low

- [ ] **[P1.T2] Input File (`prompt.md`) Monitoring** (Est: 1 day)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The script checks the modification time of `prompt.md` every 200ms. A change is detected reliably.
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Testing Requirements:** Unit test to verify that a file modification updates the internal state

- [ ] **[P1.T3] Stdin/Stdout Bridging** (Est: 2 days)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** When a file change is detected, the full content of `prompt.md` is written to the `gemini` process's `stdin`. Data from the process's `stdout` is read in a non-blocking manner.
  - **Dependencies:** P1.T1, P1.T2
  - **Risk Level:** Medium - This is where I/O buffering issues may first appear

- [ ] **[P1.T4] Append-Only Output Logging (`response.md`)** (Est: 1 day)
  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** All data read from the `gemini` process's `stdout` is immediately appended to `response.md`. The file is never overwritten.
  - **Dependencies:** P1.T3
  - **Testing Requirements:** Unit test to ensure file is opened in append mode and content is written correctly

**Quality Gates:**

- [ ] Manual test: A 5-turn conversation is completed successfully
- [ ] Code is formatted with `black`
- [ ] Basic unit tests for file I/O and time checking are written

---

### **Phase 2: Reliability & Hardening - Week 2 (`Not Started`)**

**Goal:** Make the core workflow robust enough for daily, uninterrupted use by handling common errors and edge cases gracefully.

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] All Phase 1 Exit Criteria are met
- [ ] A functional "steel thread" prototype is committed to the `develop` branch

**Exit Criteria:**

- [ ] The bridge automatically restarts the `gemini` process if it crashes
- [ ] The script handles file creation and exits cleanly on `Ctrl+C`
- [ ] The tool is verified to work on Windows and a primary Linux/macOS environment
- [ ] Test coverage reaches at least 60%

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **[P2.T1] Process Crash Detection & Restart** (Est: 2 days)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The main loop checks `process.poll()`. If the process has terminated, it is restarted. Implement a simple backoff delay (e.g., 2s, 4s, 8s) for restarts. After 3 failed attempts, the script exits with an error.
  - **Dependencies:** Phase 1 implementation
  - **Risk Level:** Medium - Logic can be tricky to test effectively

- [ ] **[P2.T2] Graceful Shutdown (Ctrl+C)** (Est: 1 day)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Wrapping the main loop in a `try...finally` block ensures the child `gemini` process is terminated when the bridge script is stopped with `Ctrl+C`. No orphaned processes are left.
  - **Dependencies:** Phase 1 implementation
  - **Testing Requirements:** Manual test is required to verify process termination

- [ ] **[P2.T3] Automatic File Creation & UTF-8 Support** (Est: 1 day)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** On startup, the script checks for `prompt.md` and `response.md` and creates them if they don't exist. All file I/O and subprocess communication explicitly uses `encoding='utf-8'`.
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Testing Requirements:** Unit test with a temporary directory to verify file creation. Test with non-ASCII characters

- [ ] **[P2.T4] Cross-Platform Validation** (Est: 1 day)
  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The full user journey is tested and confirmed to be working on both Windows and a Unix-like system (macOS or Linux).
  - **Dependencies:** All other Phase 2 tasks
  - **Risk Level:** Medium - This is the primary mitigation for the `stdout` buffering risk

**Quality Gates:**

- [ ] All unit tests passing with >60% coverage
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Manual testing checklist for crash recovery and shutdown completed on target platforms

---

### **Phase 3: Documentation & Release - Week 3 (`Not Started`)**

**Goal:** Finalize the tool for public use with clear documentation, high-quality code, and robust test coverage.

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] All Phase 2 Exit Criteria are met
- [ ] The tool is stable and functionally complete for the MVP scope

**Exit Criteria:**

- [ ] A clear `README.md` is written with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Code is well-commented, especially the polling and subprocess logic
- [ ] Final test coverage is >= 85%
- [ ] A startup confirmation message is implemented

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **[P3.T1] Increase Test Coverage to >= 85%** (Est: 2 days)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Write `pytest` tests for process restart logic, edge cases in file handling, and error conditions. Use `pytest-mock` to isolate components.
  - **Dependencies:** All code from Phase 1 & 2

- [ ] **[P3.T2] Write `README.md`** (Est: 1 day)

  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The `README` includes a project summary, setup steps, usage instructions (the side-by-side editor workflow), and a troubleshooting section. A new user can be operational in under 5 minutes.
  - **Dependencies:** None

- [ ] **[P3.T3] Code Cleanup and Commenting** (Est: 1 day)
  - **Status:** `Not Started`
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Add inline comments explaining complex parts (e.g., non-blocking reads, restart backoff). Ensure all code adheres to `black` and `pylint` standards. Implement the "Startup Confirmation Message" feature.
  - **Dependencies:** All code from Phase 1 & 2

**Quality Gates:**

- [ ] All unit tests passing with >=85% coverage
- [ ] `README.md` is reviewed by a peer for clarity
- [ ] Final manual test of the full user journey using only the `README` for instructions

## **4. Risk Tracker**

### **High-Risk Areas Requiring Special Attention**

#### **Active Risks**

- **ðŸ”´ HIGH: Subprocess I/O Buffering** - Different operating systems buffer `stdout` from child processes differently

  - **Mitigation:** Test on both Windows and macOS/Linux early in Phase 2
  - **Status:** Monitoring

- **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: `gemini` CLI Instability** - The external tool may crash frequently or have breaking changes
  - **Mitigation:** Process restart logic in Phase 2 is the primary defense
  - **Status:** Monitoring

#### **Resolved Risks**

- None yet
